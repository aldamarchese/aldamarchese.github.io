<br>
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Università della Svizzera italiana](https://idep.usi.ch).
<br><br>

I completed the [Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics](https://szgerzensee.ch), hosted by the Swiss National Bank, and before starting my PhD I was a pre-doc at [AXA Research Lab on Gender Equality](https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu) under the supervision of Prof. [Paola Profeta](https://sites.google.com/view/paola-profeta).
<br>
I hold a M.Sc. in European and International Public Policy from [the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk) and a M.Sc. in Politics and Policy Analysis from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.it/en).
<br><br>

My research is in the field of gender economics, with a particular interest on political economy, labor economics and economics of education.
