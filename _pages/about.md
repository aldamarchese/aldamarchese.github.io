<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD candidate in Economics at <a href="https://idep.usi.ch">Università della Svizzera italiana</a> under the supervision of Prof. [Patricia Funk](https://sites.google.com/site/patriciafelicitasfunk/).
<br><br>

I completed the <a href="https://szgerzensee.ch">Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics</a>, hosted by the Swiss National Bank. Before starting my PhD I was a pre-doc at <a href="https://genderlab.unibocconi.eu">AXA Research Lab on Gender Equality</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paola-profeta">Paola Profeta</a>. I hold a M.Sc. in European and International Public Policy from <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk">the London School of Economics and Political Science</a> and a M.Sc. in Politics and Policy Analysis from <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en">Bocconi University</a>.
<br><br>

My research is in the field of gender economics, with a particular interest in political economy, labor economics, and economics of education.
