## Workshop IdEP in Sustainabile Economics

In March 2025 I co-organised the first edition of WISE (Workshop IdEP in Sustainabile Economics), a three-day student-led workshop for junior researchers on applied economics. Ludovica Gazz√© (University of Warwick) joined us as keynote speaker, together with junior researchers from all over Europe.
